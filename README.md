# AWSEntityIncidentResponse 

AWSEntityIncidentResponse is an `automated isolation solution for an AWS incident` that allows `security responders` to do `forensics, eradication, and recovery during an Incident.`


This solution focuses on separating multiple targets so that each target only sees and affects itself‚Äîas a containment strategy.
AWSEntityIncidentResponse automates the isolation of an Amazon EC2 instance, an IAM User, an IAM Role, and an AWS Lambda by using an AWS Lambda function that AWS SNS triggers.
The solution supports cross-account and cross-region Incident Response. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have an active AWS account.
* You have IAM permissions that meet requirements to deploy solution resources through AWS Cloudformation.  
* You have AWS CLI configured (if you plan to test the solution locally)
